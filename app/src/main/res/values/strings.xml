        Coffee Shop and Gallery offers a unique coffee house environment unlike any other in Macon.
        We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup of coffee (although you are more than welcome to do that),
        we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy that tailor-made cup of coffee.
        If you need to work, we have a seating area created specifically for you.
        If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating area in front of a stone fire place that is perfect for your weary mind and body.
        We offer a delicious variety of coffee from Safehouse Coffee made by our professionally trained baristas.
        We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages.
        All of our sauces &amp; syrups are made in-house with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives)
        ensuring you the highest quality in taste &amp; health.
        You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious sweet treats made by our very own baker.
        We look forward to serving you at Taste &amp; See Coffee Shop and Gallery!
